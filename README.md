# JanGoOConverter
A Simple Header file for necessoray conversions in cpp

# Description
I created this simple header file named "JanGoOConverter.h".
In this release I have only included four functions that will perform conversion respectively:

1. int char_to_int(char c)
    It will receive character as a parameter and will return integer i.e., '1' -> 1

2.  char int_to_char(int i)
    It will receive integer as a parameter and will return character i.e., 1 -> '1'

3.  int str_to_int(string str)
    It will receive string as a parameter and will return integer i.e., "12" -> 12

4.  string int_to_str(int integer)
    It will receive integer as a parameter and will return string i.e., 12 -> "12"
